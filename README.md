# Korah â€” Text Sentiment Prediction Engine

Korah is a full-stack, containerized web application that performs real-time sentiment analysis on multilingual user-input text. It uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to determine whether the input is positive, negative, or neutral.

The app features a retro-themed React frontend styled like an old-school terminal, and a FastAPI backend powered by Hugging Face Transformers. Docker ensures easy deployment and reproducibility.
