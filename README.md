Here's a rewritten and **personalized `README.md`** for your project **Korah**, replacing the previous credits and making it your own, while maintaining clarity and professionalism:

# **Korah — Sentiment Analysis App**

Korah is a full-stack, containerized web application that performs real-time sentiment analysis on user-input text. It uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to determine whether the input is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

The app features a **retro-themed React frontend** styled like an old-school terminal, and a **FastAPI backend** powered by **Hugging Face Transformers** for multilingual support. Docker support ensures easy deployment and reproducibility.
